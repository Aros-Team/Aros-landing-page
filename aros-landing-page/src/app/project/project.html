    This is a software dedicated to managing restaurant orders efficiently.
    It allows waitstaff to take orders directly from tables using tablets or mobile devices, 
    which are then sent to the kitchen in real-time. The system includes features such as menu management,
    order tracking, and billing, enhancing the overall dining experience for both customers and staff.
